CURRENT APP STATE — DO NOT CHANGE

Frontend:
- Flutter app
- Riverpod used for state
- One main login/auth flow

Backend:
- Supabase authentication
- Supabase database with security rules

Known Problems:
- After logout, staff login screen does not show
- App logic changes but screen does not update

IMPORTANT:
This document describes how the app works TODAY.
Do not try to “fix” auth until we finish Sprint 0.
